# Recommender_Sys

A recommendation system, or recommender system tries to make predictions on user preferences and make recommendations which should interest customers.

Recommendation systems typically appear on many e-commerce sites because of providing better conversion rates. According to some articles you can find on the Internet, 35% of Amazon's sales are result of its recommendation engine.

There are basically two approaches to make recommendations:

    Collaborative filtering (or social filtering)
    Content-based filtering


A Speaking Recommender System using and content based filtering 

This type of filter does not involve other users if not ourselves. Based on what we like, the algorithm will simply pick items with similar content to recommend us.

Content-based filtering, also referred to as cognitive filtering, recommends items based on a comparison between the content of the items and a user profile. The content of each item is represented as a set of descriptors or terms, typically the words that occur in a document. The user profile is represented with the same terms and built up by analyzing the content of items which have been seen by the user.
